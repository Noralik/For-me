# 🗂️ Misc / Scrap Branch

## 📌 Purpose of This Branch

The meaning of this branch is simple — it serves as a **storage space for miscellaneous content**, including:

- random images,
- wallpapers,
- background pictures,
- unused assets,
- personal scrap files,
- separate links or references.

This branch is not structured or organized and may contain experimental or temporary files.

It acts as a **dump/storage area** for anything that doesn’t fit into other branches or doesn’t require proper categorization.

## ⚠️ Note
This branch may include incomplete, broken, or unoptimized files.  
It is **not intended for production use**.
